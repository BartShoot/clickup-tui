# Start app

In root directory:

```bash
go run main.go 
```

or
```bash
go install
```

To add executable to `$HOME/go/bin` so you can use it like any other app: `$HOME/go/bin/clickup-tui`.

It's recommended to add `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"` to your bashrc if you don't have it already so you can call command by only `clickup-tui` after installing.
